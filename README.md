# Libft
The objective of this project is to create my own library that includes the most common functions used when programming in C#

## Mandatory
### Functions that do not use dynamic memory allocation (malloc):
  - **Memset**. Copies the character c (an *unsigned char*) to the first len characters of b.
```
void *memset(void *b, int c, size_t len)
```
It is necessary to **cast** b to char *. Void *b is a pointer that can point to any data type, but to perform byte-by-byte operations in memory, it needs to be treated as char *, since the characters occupy a single byte of memory. 

To do the casting: 
```
char *ptr = (char *)b
```
Due to the function is declared as void *, it must have return statement inside it.
  - **Memcpy**. Copies n bytes from the source memory (src) to the destination memory (dst). If both memories overlap, the behavior is undefined.
```
void *memcpy(void *dst, const void *src, size_t n)
```
A pointer to the original destination address (before the cpy) is returned.
  - **Memmove**. Copies len bytes from source memory (src) to destination memory (dst). Controls string overlapping, THIS HAPPENS WHEN THE ORIGIN IS TO THE LEFT OF DESTINATION AND OVERLAPPED. In this case it starts copying from the end instead of the beginning.
```
void *memmove(void *dst, const void *src, size_t len)
```
  - **Strlcpy**. Copies dstsize -1 characters from src to dst (mashing what is in dst) and guaranteeing NUL termination. It returns the length of the string it is trying to copy, i.e. src (regardless of how many characters are copied)

dstsize = target length (must have enough space to copy the whole src and include the NUL)
```
size_t	ft_strlcpy(char *dst, const char *src, size_t dstsize)
```
  - **Strlcat**. Appends src to the end of dst. Appends at most dstsize - strlen(dst) - 1.

dstsize = length of the final string (must have enough space to be able to concatenate src and add the NUL slash). Guarantees NUL termination except if dstsize = 0, or strlen(dst) > dstsize. The function returns the length of the string you are trying to create, i.e. the sum of length dst + src
```
size_t	ft_strlcat(char *dst, const char *src, size_t dstsize)
```
  - **Strchr**. Locates the first occurrence of c (converted to char) in the string pointed to by s. C may be worth the NUL character, and the function would locate the termination of the string.

Returns the pointer pointing to the located character, or NULL if c does not exist in the string.
```
char	*ft_strchr(const char *s, int c)
```
  - **Strrchr**. Locates the last occurrence of c (converted to char) in the string pointed to by s
  - **Strncmp**. Compares n characters of strings (s1 and s2) lexicographically. The comparison is done using unsigned char. 

WHEN IT REACHES A NULL CHARACTER, IT STOPS, AND IF THE STRINGS WERE EQUAL, IT RETURNS ZERO.
```
int	ft_strncmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n)
```
  - **Memchr**. Locates a byte in the byte string. Locates the first occurrence of c (converted to *unsigned char*) in the string s.

Returns the pointer to the occurrence, or NUL if it is not found in the selected n bytes.
If the null value (\0) is passed as a character, it returns nothing. The same if you pass an empty string (and c = '\0').
```
void	*ft_memchr(const void *s, int c, size_t n)
```
  - **Memcmp**. Compares n bytes of string s1 to string s2.

The function returns zero if the strings are equal, otherwise it returns the difference between the two differing bytes (treated as unsigned char).
Empty strings are considered identical.

WHEN IT REACHES A NUL CHARACTER IT DOESN'T STOP, IT KEEPS CHECKING THE NEXT CHARACTERS UNTIL IT FINDS A DIFFERENCE AND GIVES IT TO YOU. That's the difference between this function and strncmp
```
int	ft_memcmp(const void *s1, const void *s2, size_t n)
```
  - **Strnstr**. Locates a substring in a string. Locates the first occurrence of the string needle (null-terminated) in the string haystack, where len characters are searched for.
     - If needle is an empty string, haystack is returned.
	- If needle is not found in haystack, NULL is returned.
	- If needle is found in haystack, the pointer pointing to it is returned.
```
char	*ft_strnstr(const char *haystack, const char *needle, size_t len)
```
  - **Atoi**. Converts an ASCII string to integer.
    - Returns the number found. If a non-numeric character (letter, ...) is found, it stops and displays the numbers up to that letter.
    - If it cannot convert the string, it returns 0.
    - The first zero is ignored.
    - It takes into account the - and + sign, if it is only one.
    - If it finds space, page break, new line, carriage return, horizontal tab or vertical tab, it ignores them.
    - The minimum value of an int is : -2147483648
    - The maximum value is 2147483647
    - In case of overflow, the return value is not defined.
```
int	ft_atoi(const char *str)
```


### Functions with malloc
Malloc allows a memory allocation at runtime, in a memory region called 'heap'. It is necessary to use free (freeing that memory) anytime malloc is used.

 - **Calloc**. It stores enough space for an array of *count* elements that are *size* bytes in length. THEREFORE THE MEMORY IT NEEDS IS COUNT * SIZE. 

Each element is initialized to 0 (using memset or bzero).

It returns a pointer to the allocated space, which can store any type of object, although it is convenient to cast it to char *.

If an error occurs, a NULL pointer is returned.
```
void *calloc(size_t count, size_t size)
```
 - **Strdup**. Stores enough memory for a copy of a string (s1). It makes the copy and returns the pointer s1.

If there is not enough memory, NULL is returned.
```
char	*ft_strdup(const char *s1)
```
 - **Substr**. Creates a substring from the string s, starting at start, and of length len. If memory fails it returns null.

If start is > than the length of s, nothing is returned, only '\0', AND MEMORY MUST BE SAVED FOR THAT NULL ONLY.

If len > than the length of s, MEMORY MUST BE SAVED IN MALLOC ONLY FOR STRLEN(S) - START + 1.
```
char	*ft_substr(char const *s, unsigned int start, size_t len)
```
- **Strtrim**. Eliminates the characters given by the string set, in the main string s1 from the beginning and from the end, until it finds a character not belonging to set.
```
char	*ft_strtrim(char const *s1, char const *set)
```
 - **Split**. Reserves an array of strings (pointer to pointer) resulting from separating the string 's' into substrings using the character 'c' as delimiter. The array ends with a NULL pointer
```
char	**ft_split(char const *s, char c)
```
 - **Itoa**. Converts an integer to a null-terminated string. Returns the pointer to the string.

The minimum value of an int is : -2147483648, which would occupy 12 bytes (including the sign and null). THERE IS ALWAYS A SMALLER MINIMUM INT, THAN THE MAXIMUM, BECAUSE OF THE SIGN. THEREFORE, IT IS NECESSARY TO CAST WITH AN UNSIGNED INT.
```
char *ft_itoa(int n)
```
 - **Strmapi**. To each character of the string 's' apply the function 'f' giving as character the index of each character and the character itself. It generates a new string with the result of the successive use of 'f'
```
char	*ft_strmapi(char const *s, char (*f)(unsigned int, char))
```
 - **Striteri**. To each character of the string 's', it applies the function 'f' giving as parameters the index of each character within 's' and the address of the character itself, which can be
character itself, which may be modified if necessary
```
void	ft_striteri(char *s, void (*f)(unsigned int, char*))
```
## Bonus
The bonus part consists of working with linked lists.

Linked lists are a collection of self-referenced structures called ***nodes***. Where each node has a stored data and also a ***reference to the next element***. The node is created with dynamic memory, and they allow to store and modify data at run time.

Linked lists are similar to arrays, except that an element is accessed by a *pointer* instead of an *index*. Scrolling is done in one direction only, from the first to the last element.

 Structure of linked lists:
 ```
typedef 	struct s_list
{
	void		*content;
	struct s_list	*next;           	   â€”-> self-reference. Pointer to data type
} 	t_list;	                                   â€”-> structure variables. It can be used to create new node type variables.
```
